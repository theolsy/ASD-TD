The dataset is divided into two parts: ASD and TD. 
Each subfolder contains time-labeled subfolders representing individual data. 
Within these, new_A1 corresponds to the blank paradigm, new_A2 represents the overlap paradigm, new_C indicates the person-gaze paradigm, and new_D denotes the exogenous-cueing paradigm. 
Each paradigm folder contains four CSV files: emotion_predictions for facial expression features, EyesRegionNum for gaze features, Headpose for head pose features, and keypoints for facial landmark features.
